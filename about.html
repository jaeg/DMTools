    <div class="textblock">
        Welcome to my DMTools app! There's not much here at the moment but eventually I hope to have an entire suite of tools to make your campaigns fun and easy! Here's a list of what I plan to offer:
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive Initiative Tracker</li>
            <li>A customizable monster library that allows you to add the stats, abilities, etc. You can then inject these monsters into your initiative list to make accessing their info during an encounter even easier!</li>
            <li>A campaign/milestone storeboard. Easily keep track of your story with the built in editor!</li>
            <li>Quick facts! A knowledgebase of D&D 5e terminology.</li>
        </ul>
